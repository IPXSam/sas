SAS is a DCPU-16 assembler.
sas stands for simple assembler. It outputs object files which then
are fed into the linker to then generate binary files. Why can't it
generate binary files directly? this is because I needed tools that
would work the way I wanted for system/kernel development.

The assembler is written entirely in C with yacc and lex for parsing.
Released under the the GPL v2.

It supports multiple assembly files, and always generates 1 object
file. Here are some directives it supports:

DIRECTIVES:
DAT <value>/"<string>", ...	outputs values and 16 bit strings

TODO:
.ascii8 "<string>"		outputs 8 bit strings
				(2 characters packed in a word)
.org <address>			set instruction origin to <address>
.define <symbol> <value>	set <symbol> to <value> (is global)
.fill <length> <value>		fills binary with <value> for <length> words
