The assembler is coded in C with yacc and lex for parsing. Released under the
GPL v2. The assembler outputs object files which contain all defined and 
undefined symbols along with the binary of the source file.

Also multiple files can be input to the assembler.

TODO:
- add assembler directives
- DAT support
